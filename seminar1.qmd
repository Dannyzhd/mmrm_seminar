# Longitudinal Studies

Studies in which individuals are measured repeatedly through time.

-   measurements of the same individuals are taken repeatedly through time.

-   allow direct study of change over time.

## Longitudinal Data

::: notes
draw a picture here.
:::

### example1:

### example2:

## Objective:

Characterize the change in response over time and the factors that influence change.

capture **within-individual change**.

remove variability among individuals.

## Properties of Longitudinal Data:

### Correlation

repeated measures on the same individual are usually positively correlated

### Variability

variability is often heterogeneous across measurement occasions.

# Mixed model of repeated measure

## Notations

One way to symbolize longitudinal data is by adding an index for time(compared to its non-longitudinal counterpart)

-   Let $Y_{ij}$ denote the sequence of measurements for the $i$th individual $i= 1,...$ N, at the $j$th occasion $j = 1, ...$ , n.

-   each observation $Y_{ij}$ has an associated set of covariates, $X\_{ij1}$ ,$X\_{ij1}$, ... , $X\_{ijp}$, where i = 1, corresponding to the intercept.

## multivariate normal distribution

$f({y}, {\mu}, \Sigma) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{\frac{p}{2}} |\Sigma|^{\frac{1}{2}}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} ({y} - {\mu})' \Sigma^{-1} ({y} - {\mu})\right)$

## Grouped covariance matrix

In some cases, we would like to estimate unique covariance matrices across groups

## REML(Restricted Maximum Likelihood Estimator)

### Motivation

MLE $\sum$ is biased in small samples -\> the diagnal elements are underestimated, leading to narrower CI, inflated test statistic and thus increased type1 error.

The main reason is that we are using the estimated $\beta$ to estimate $\sum$

-   CL

-   Empirical

-   HTYPE

::: notes
link back to previous concepts.

# Shifting to an opensource backbone

-   Well validated open source packages

-   developed by leading companies in the industry

-   coherence among packages by communication and tidy pricniple

-   great synergy and eco system formed by the packages.

::: notes
put more symbols of packages.

## R Challenges

### discrepencies with SAS

### discrepencies between pacakges

### Synchronization issues between packages

::: notes
talk about how matching is important given the highly regulated nature of pharma industry. Talk about the advantage and disadvantages of R having various packages.

## nlme, lme4

-   takes a very long time to converge

-   not enough covariance matrix types

-   degree of freedom calculation

-   Complex Syntax

## Research and communication

### Communication with Lilly's team.

::: notes
put the summary table i made with Ruqian here.

### Communication with package developers.

# mmrm package Insights

## Basic syntax demonstration

``` r
# Define a server for the Shiny app
function(input, output) {
  
  # Fill in the spot we created for a plot
  output$phonePlot <- renderPlot({
    # Render a barplot
  })
}
```

## RCPP

R is weak in some kinds of operations. If we need operations listed below, it is time to consider using Rcpp.

-   Loop operations in which later iterations depend on previous iterations.

-   Accessing each element of a vector/matrix.

-   Recurrent function calls within loops.

-   Changing the size of vectors dynamically.

-   Operations that need advanced data structures and algorithms.

## TMB

-   TMB can calculate first and second order derivatives of the likelihood function by [AD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation), or any objective function written in C++.

-   The objective function (and its derivatives) can be called from R. Hence, parameter estimation via e.g. `nlminb()` is easy.

-   The user can specify that the [Laplace approximation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_approximation) should be applied to any subset of the function arguments.

    -   Yields marginal likelihood in latent variable model.

-   Standard deviations of any parameter, or derived parameter, obtained by the ['delta method'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_method).

-   Pre and post-processing of data done in R.

-   TMB is based on state-of-the art software: [CppAD](http://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/), [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), \...

# My ongoing project

## Develop utility function of mmrm

-   utilize the things I learnt above

-   leverage the advanced functional programming I accumulated in the past year during Taffy development.

## Internal R template

-   Explore building our own TFL and shiny generating flow.

-   Utilize rtables, tern, teal.

-   Potentially build internal packages to potentially utilizing Rcpp
